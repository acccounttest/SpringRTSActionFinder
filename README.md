# SpringRTSActionFinder
Capture actions in a RTS game, currently while playing as before as spectator, randomly or on selection, later teams were regrouped and forced by allies after selection and by default, working solution is widget list order and status needed differently, but teams selection can stop or continue later because it was stopped to works like that, maybe add a team function is useful
