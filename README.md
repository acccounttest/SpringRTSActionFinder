# SpringRTSActionFinder
Capture actions in a RTS game, currently while playing as before as spectator, randomly or on selection, later teams were regrouped and forced by allies after selection and by default, working solution is widget list order and status needed differently, but teams selection can stop or continue later because it was stopped to works like that, maybe add a team function is useful.


Originally made in lua code, there are many tricks of others complementaries widgets:
 - memories and structures
 - widget order list
 - keybinds and more combinations in game from config file
 - config reloader for a starting order definitive or not
 - a new keyboard layout for avoid anything else
 - a new function for teams as well as spec or a player.


This is normal behaviour, the initial intention is not based on data, only the unit position that should already be seen cannot be reported and executed consecutively directly, the choosen destination are random in queues, the records and anchors can be done but usually its not necessary or enough.

Script is based on original author xyz, thank to it's genious tries 10 years before anybody, i tried spam people by IRC to inform about that trick in early 2010-2011 but they were apparently not ready for this piece of code undetectable by many poeples and reasons.


Original post about presentation and code access, i will duplicate it only here.
